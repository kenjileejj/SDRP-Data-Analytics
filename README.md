# SDRP-Data-Analytics
Data Analytics of the Singapore Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (SDRP) published legal decisions.

This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence, Information Science & Law module conducted in the National University of Singapore, Faculty of Law. 

There are several things which may help to improve this project:

(a) Expansion of Dataset beyond SDRP cases given the limited dataset in local SDRP decisions. The limited dataset limits the ability of machine learning models to apply satisfactory logistic regression models and derive satisfactory conclusions.

(b) Selection of more pertinent attributes out of our laundry list of attributes for your thesis.

The csv file contains the list of data sets of all SDRP decisions uploaded until 1 Apr 2017. Any user may seek to clean up the csv file for your own purposes, as we have sought to canvass as much attributes as possible for our analysis.

The python files contains the code which we have used to engage in linear and logistic regression models to conduct our analysis.

# Instructions
(1) Download the files
